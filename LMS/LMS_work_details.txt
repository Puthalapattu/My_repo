LMS - Library Management System


OPERATIONS (FUNCTIONAL REQs) :
    1 - CREATE USER
    2 - DELETE USER
    3 - UPDATE USER DETAILS
    4 - UPDATE USER BOOK(S) DETAILS
    5 - ADD BOOK


MODULES I'M USING :
    os = 'TO CREATE AND MANAGE/MANIPULATE FILES'
    datetime = 'TO SAVE DATE AND TIME OF USER ACTIONS'
    pickle = 'TO SAVE USER DATA AND BOOKS DATA TO HARD DISK IN ENCRPTED FORM'


FILES :
    UserDetails.txt = 'STORES INFO ABOUT USER, LIKE : NAME, ADDRESS, NO.OF BOOKS USING
                       NO.OF BOOKS USED, BOOKs ISSUED DATE, FINE FEE, BOOK SUBMIT TIME EXTENTION(RENUAL)
                       AND I'LL ADD IF ANYTHINGS COME INTO MY MIND.'

    BookDetails.txt = 'STORES THE INFO ABOUT THE BOOKS LIKE : BOOKNAME, BOOKNO(PRIMARY), BOOKAUTHOR,
                       NO.OF TIMES BOOK USED'


KEEP IN CHECKS : 
    1 - Everytime when I perform user data or book data related operations I need to update the
    data accordingly so that I will have the up to date data for future purposes.

    2 - I'm gonna use dictionaries to work with user and book data.

    For now this is it may be I'll add new ones in future.
